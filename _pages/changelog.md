### `Latest`
# **Version 1.2.1**
#### February 2026

## Three New Ways to Feel Better

Stressed? Distracted? Ruminating? We built tools for that—backed by peer-reviewed research, not influencer trends.

---

### Breathwork

**Calm your nervous system in 2-5 minutes.**

Four techniques, each with guided animations and haptic feedback:

- **Cyclic Sighing** — Stanford researchers found this specific pattern beat mindfulness meditation for mood improvement
- **Box Breathing** — Used by Navy SEALs and elite athletes for instant composure
- **4-7-8** — The bedtime breathing technique that reduces pre-sleep anxiety
- **Extended Exhale** — The simplest hack: breathe out longer than you breathe in. Your body does the rest

Track your sessions. See the science. Build the habit.

### Focus Sessions

**Protect your attention. Get more done.**

Research shows task-switching costs you 23 minutes of recovery—every single time. Our focus tools help you stay in the zone:

- **Pomodoro (25/5)** — Validated in 32 studies with 5,270 participants
- **Deep Work (90 min)** — For complex problems requiring sustained thought
- **Progressive** — Adapts duration to your actual focus level
- Plus 3 more patterns for different work styles

Add ambient sounds: brown noise for blocking distractions, rain for calm focus, coffee shop for creative energy.

Track focused minutes. Build streaks. See your progress.

### Journaling

**195 prompts. Zero blank page anxiety.**

We curated prompts from positive psychology and cognitive behavioral therapy—the techniques therapists actually recommend:

- **Gratitude** — "Three good things and why they happened" (research shows the 'why' is crucial)
- **Reframe** — Challenge negative thoughts with structured CBT questions
- **Self-Compassion** — What would you tell a friend? Now tell yourself
- **Expressive Writing** — Deep processing for difficult experiences (with safety guidance)
- Plus 10 more categories

Micro mode (2-5 min) for busy days. Deep mode (15-20 min) for real processing. All entries private and encrypted by default.

**Breathe. Focus. Reflect.**
