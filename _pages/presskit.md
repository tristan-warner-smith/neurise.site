## What is Neurise?

Most wellness apps tell you to "practice gratitude" or "try meditation" but leave you wondering where to start. Neurise takes a different approach: it suggests exactly what to do right now, and tells you why it works.

The app includes over 1,300 science-based suggestions. Each one comes with research references, statistics, insights, and links to books and podcasts for those who want to go deeper.

Neurise adapts to your real-life constraints. Only have 2 minutes? Low energy? No budget? It finds the right suggestion for your situation, removing the friction that stops most people from building better mental health habits.

## Key Features

* **1,300+ Science-Based Suggestions** Evidence-based happiness practices you can act on right now
* **Context-Aware Personalization** Adapts to time of day and your available resources: time, energy, and money
* **The What & Why** Every suggestion includes research references, statistics, insights, and curated links to books and podcasts
* **Gratitude Journaling** Dynamic prompts that evolve with your practice
* **Mood Tracking** Log how you feel throughout the day
* **Reflections & Journey Tracking** Monitor your progress and see what's working
* **Privacy First** Your data is never shared with third parties
