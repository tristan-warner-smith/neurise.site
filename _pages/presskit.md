## What is Neurise?

Most wellness apps tell you to "practice gratitude" or "try meditation" but leave you wondering where to start. Neurise takes a different approach: it suggests exactly what to do right now, and tells you why it works.

The app includes over 1,300 science-based suggestions. Each one comes with research references, statistics, insights, and links to books and podcasts for those who want to go deeper.

Neurise adapts to your real-life constraints. Only have 2 minutes? Low energy? No budget? It finds the right suggestion for your situation, removing the friction that stops most people from building better mental health habits.

## Key Features

* **1,300+ Science-Based Suggestions** Evidence-based happiness practices you can act on right now
* **Context-Aware Personalization** Adapts to time of day and your available resources: time, energy, and money
* **The What & Why** Every suggestion includes research references, statistics, insights, and curated links to books and podcasts
* **Gratitude Journaling** Dynamic prompts that evolve with your practice
* **Mood Tracking** Log how you feel throughout the day
* **Reflections & Journey Tracking** Monitor your progress and see what's working
* **Privacy First** Your data is never shared with third parties

## Who is Neurise for?

Neurise is built for people who are tired of vague wellness advice. It's for anyone who wants to improve their mental health but doesn't know where to start, or has tried other apps and found them too shallow.

It's particularly valuable for busy professionals, students, and anyone who needs actionable guidance that fits into a real schedule with real constraints.

## Pricing

Neurise is free to download and use. The core app includes all essential features for daily mood tracking and habit building. Premium features unlock advanced insights and additional content.
