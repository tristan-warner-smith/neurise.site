# How to Give Feedback

Your feedback helps make Neurise better! There are several ways you can share your thoughts, report bugs, or request features.

---

## Beta Feedback - Share Screenshots with Context

The easiest way to give feedback is directly from what you're seeing in the app. Take a screenshot, tap "Share Beta Feedback...", annotate it, and send it directly to me with context.

<video width="100%" controls style="max-width: 400px; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">
  <source src="/assets/feedback/beta-feedback-optimized.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

**How it works:**
1. Take a screenshot while using the app
2. Tap "Share Beta Feedback..." from the share menu
3. Annotate the screenshot to highlight what you want to share
4. Add your feedback and send it
5. I'll receive it instantly with all the context I need to help you or implement your suggestion
