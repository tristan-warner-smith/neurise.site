# Feeling Alone? You're Not Alone in That


Loneliness is something many of us struggle with, yet the science of happiness and well-being has revealed powerful strategies that can make a real difference.

Strong social networks and purposeful living significantly extend healthy lifespan and happiness.

In this guide, we'll explore evidence-based approaches to loneliness, drawing on the latest research in positive psychology and behavioral science. You'll learn practical strategies you can implement today, backed by studies from leading researchers in the field.

Whether you're just starting your wellness journey or looking to deepen your practice, these insights will help you make meaningful progress.

## Understanding Loneliness

Before diving into strategies, it's important to understand why addressing loneliness is crucial for our well-being.

Purpose fuels motivation and resilience; close bonds protect against stress and loneliness. Together they lift both happiness and health-span.

The connection between loneliness and happiness is well-documented in research. When we actively work on this area of our lives, we often see ripple effects in other domains—from our relationships to our work performance.


Research insight: Strong social networks and purposeful living significantly extend healthy lifespan and happiness. (Levy et al., 2020)

## Strategy 1: Purpose

Purpose fuels motivation and resilience; close bonds protect against stress and loneliness. Together they lift both happiness and health-span.

**How to apply this:**

Write a three-line purpose statement and text one friend to schedule a 60–90 minute activity this week that expresses it (e.g., volunteer together, help a neighbor, or share a skill).

Research note: "Strong social networks and purposeful living significantly extend healthy lifespan and happiness." — Levy et al., 2020

## Strategy 2: Social Connection

Regular social contact reduces loneliness and buffers stress. Prioritizing relationships boosts mood, motivation, and long-term well-being.

**How to apply this:**

Schedule and complete a 30-minute call or coffee with a friend or family member this week—put it on your calendar now and send the invite.

Research note: "Maintaining strong social connections is critical for mental and physical health" — Waldinger et al., 2015

## Strategy 3: Relationships

Consistent connection buffers stress and increases meaning. Investing time in people is one of the highest-return happiness habits.

**How to apply this:**

Create a repeating 30-minute weekly check-in with a key person (calendar invite + brief agenda), and complete your first call or meetup this week.

Research note: "Quality relationships mitigate stress and predict better health and longevity." — Waldinger et al., 2015

## What the Research Shows

The strategies we've discussed aren't just anecdotal—they're backed by rigorous scientific research. Here's what the evidence tells us:

**Research insights:**

> Strong social networks and purposeful living significantly extend healthy lifespan and happiness.
> — Levy et al., 2020

> People with a clear sense of purpose live 7-8 years longer than those without.
> — National Institutes on Aging, 2019

> People with negative attitudes toward aging live shorter lives.
> — Levy et al., 2016

> Maintaining strong social connections is critical for mental and physical health
> — Waldinger et al., 2015

## Putting It Into Practice

Knowing the science is one thing—putting it into practice is another. Here's how to start:

**Start small**: Pick just one strategy from this guide and commit to trying it for a week. Small, consistent actions compound over time.

**Track your progress**: Notice how you feel before and after implementing these practices. Awareness helps reinforce positive habits.

**Be patient**: Meaningful change takes time. Research shows it can take anywhere from 18 to 254 days to form a new habit, with an average of 66 days.

**Get support**: Consider using tools designed to help you build these habits. Apps like Neurise provide personalized, science-backed recommendations tailored to your specific needs and goals.

**Quick-start actions:**

- Write a three-line purpose statement and text one friend to schedule a 60–90 minute activity this week that expresses it (e.g., volunteer together, he...
- Schedule and complete a 30-minute call or coffee with a friend or family member this week—put it on your calendar now and send the invite.
- Create a repeating 30-minute weekly check-in with a key person (calendar invite + brief agenda), and complete your first call or meetup this week.

## Conclusion

Improving loneliness is a journey, not a destination. The strategies we've explored in this guide—backed by research from leading scientists in positive psychology—offer a roadmap for meaningful progress.

Remember that small, consistent actions often outperform ambitious but unsustainable efforts. Start with one technique that resonates with you, practice it until it feels natural, then gradually expand your repertoire.

The science is clear: we have more control over our well-being than we often realize. By applying evidence-based strategies, you can make real progress toward a happier, more fulfilling life.
