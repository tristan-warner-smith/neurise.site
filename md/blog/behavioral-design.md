# Design Your Life for Success


Behavioral Design is something many of us struggle with, yet the science of happiness and well-being has revealed powerful strategies that can make a real difference.

Using defaults and automatic enrollment leverages inertia for beneficial behaviors, such as retirement savings, resulting in significantly increased participation rates.

In this guide, we'll explore evidence-based approaches to behavioral design, drawing on the latest research in positive psychology and behavioral science. You'll learn practical strategies you can implement today, backed by studies from leading researchers in the field.

Whether you're just starting your wellness journey or looking to deepen your practice, these insights will help you make meaningful progress.

## Understanding Behavioral Design

Before diving into strategies, it's important to understand why behavioral design matters for our overall well-being.

Harnessing inertia supports autonomy and long-term well-being by making the best choice the easy choice. Defaults free mental energy for what matters and increase financial security.

The connection between behavioral design and happiness is well-documented in research. When we actively work on this area of our lives, we often see ripple effects in other domains—from our relationships to our work performance.


Research insight: Using defaults and automatic enrollment leverages inertia for beneficial behaviors, such as retirement savings, resulting in significantly increased participation rates. (Thaler & Benartzi, 2004)

## Strategy 1: Status Quo Bias

Harnessing inertia supports autonomy and long-term well-being by making the best choice the easy choice. Defaults free mental energy for what matters and increase financial security.

**How to apply this:**

Turn on automatic enrollment and auto-increase for your retirement plan (or set an automatic monthly transfer to savings) and review default options for subscriptions or benefits you can optimize.

## Strategy 2: Natural Movement

Regular, natural movement boosts cardiovascular health and daily positive emotion. Small, repeatable swaps are easier to maintain than intense workouts.

**How to apply this:**

Choose one nearby errand and do it on foot or by bike for 30 minutes today (out-and-back route).

## Strategy 3: Digital Wellbeing

Mindful tech use lowers distraction and protects time for relationships and rest. Reclaiming attention improves mood and makes room for activities that genuinely matter to you.

**How to apply this:**

Before unlocking your phone today, pause for 10–20 seconds and ask: What for? Why now? What else could I do instead? If there’s no clear purpose, do the “what else.”

Research note: "Mindful use of technology by questioning purpose and timing of phone use (WWW: What for? Why now? What else?) increases digital well-being." — Price, 2021

## What the Research Shows

The strategies we've discussed aren't just anecdotal—they're backed by rigorous scientific research. Here's what the evidence tells us:

**Key findings:**

- **Retirement plan enrollment increased from 50% to 90% by changing default to automatic enrollment**: Effect of inertia and status quo bias on savings behavior (Save More Tomorrow program)
- **Blue Zones residents take 9,000-11,000 steps daily vs. average American 4,000 steps**: Natural movement in Blue Zones (Blue Zones research)
- **No recovery observed in interpersonal trust post-pandemic; described as 'falling off a cliff'.**: Refers to trust in families, friends, coworkers after 2020 pandemic onset. (2025 World Happiness Report chapter on trust by Jan Algan, Current Blank, Claudia Senic)
- **Far right political groups show higher distrust in strangers but higher trust in close private circles; far left groups show lower interpersonal trust and higher disengagement.**: Political trust patterns linked to life satisfaction and social fabric damage. (2025 World Happiness Report chapter on trust)
- **53% increase in dining alone in the United States from 2003 to 2023**: Trend showing rising rates of solo dining, especially among youth (World Happiness Report data cited by Yan Emmanuel Denev)

## Putting It Into Practice

Knowing the science is one thing—putting it into practice is another. Here's how to start:

**Start small**: Pick just one strategy from this guide and commit to trying it for a week. Small, consistent actions compound over time.

**Track your progress**: Notice how you feel before and after implementing these practices. Awareness helps reinforce positive habits.

**Be patient**: Meaningful change takes time. Research shows it can take anywhere from 18 to 254 days to form a new habit, with an average of 66 days.

**Get support**: Consider using tools designed to help you build these habits. Apps like Neurise provide personalized, science-backed recommendations tailored to your specific needs and goals.

**Quick-start actions:**

- Turn on automatic enrollment and auto-increase for your retirement plan (or set an automatic monthly transfer to savings) and review default options f...

## Conclusion

Improving behavioral design is a journey, not a destination. The strategies we've explored in this guide—backed by research from leading scientists in positive psychology—offer a roadmap for meaningful progress.

Remember that small, consistent actions often outperform ambitious but unsustainable efforts. Start with one technique that resonates with you, practice it until it feels natural, then gradually expand your repertoire.

The science is clear: we have more control over our well-being than we often realize. By applying evidence-based strategies, you can make real progress toward a happier, more fulfilling life.
