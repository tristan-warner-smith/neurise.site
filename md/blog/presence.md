# Be Here Now: The Practice of Presence


Presence is something many of us struggle with, yet the science of happiness and well-being has revealed powerful strategies that can make a real difference.

Embracing vulnerability and active listening builds trust and deepens social connections.

In this guide, we'll explore evidence-based approaches to presence, drawing on the latest research in positive psychology and behavioral science. You'll learn practical strategies you can implement today, backed by studies from leading researchers in the field.

Whether you're just starting your wellness journey or looking to deepen your practice, these insights will help you make meaningful progress.

## Understanding Presence

Before diving into strategies, it's important to understand why presence matters for our overall well-being.

Feeling seen builds trust and belonging. Listening well also reduces your own self-focus and rumination.

The connection between presence and happiness is well-documented in research. When we actively work on this area of our lives, we often see ripple effects in other domains—from our relationships to our work performance.


Research insight: Embracing vulnerability and active listening builds trust and deepens social connections. (Epley et al., 2018)

## Strategy 1: Active Listening

Feeling seen builds trust and belonging. Listening well also reduces your own self-focus and rumination.

**How to apply this:**

Choose one person today and have a 15-minute chat: ask two open questions, reflect back key points, and share one genuine appreciation.

Research note: "Embracing vulnerability and active listening builds trust and deepens social connections." — Epley et al., 2018

## Strategy 2: Smartphone Boundaries

Face-to-face micro-interactions are key to belonging and happiness. Reducing phone presence removes a major barrier to those moments and makes connection feel easier and more rewarding.

**How to apply this:**

Try a 60-minute phone-free block during dinner or a walk today; put your device in another room or a closed bag.

## Strategy 3: Memento Mori

Remembering life’s finiteness often boosts gratitude and purpose, two reliable levers for well-being. A quick daily practice strengthens intention (autonomy) and helps you savor meaningful moments (positive emotions) and people (connection).

**How to apply this:**

Set a 5–10 minute morning timer. Sit quietly and briefly reflect on mortality—acknowledge life’s finiteness, imagine today as precious—and identify one meaningful action you will prioritize before noon.

Research note: "Brief, structured memento mori exercises are intended to cultivate gratitude and reduce reactivity, not induce rumination." — Irvine, 2017

## What the Research Shows

The strategies we've discussed aren't just anecdotal—they're backed by rigorous scientific research. Here's what the evidence tells us:

**Research insights:**

> Embracing vulnerability and active listening builds trust and deepens social connections.
> — Epley et al., 2018

> People underestimate how positively others perceive them after conversations, encouraging unnecessary withdrawal.
> — Epley et al., 2018

> Limiting phone use in social settings and schools can foster more face-to-face interaction and reduce loneliness.
> — Dunn et al., 2019

> Presence of phones reduces smiling by about 30% in social settings.
> — Dunn et al., 2019

## Putting It Into Practice

Knowing the science is one thing—putting it into practice is another. Here's how to start:

**Start small**: Pick just one strategy from this guide and commit to trying it for a week. Small, consistent actions compound over time.

**Track your progress**: Notice how you feel before and after implementing these practices. Awareness helps reinforce positive habits.

**Be patient**: Meaningful change takes time. Research shows it can take anywhere from 18 to 254 days to form a new habit, with an average of 66 days.

**Get support**: Consider using tools designed to help you build these habits. Apps like Neurise provide personalized, science-backed recommendations tailored to your specific needs and goals.

**Quick-start actions:**

- Choose one person today and have a 15-minute chat: ask two open questions, reflect back key points, and share one genuine appreciation.
- Try a 60-minute phone-free block during dinner or a walk today; put your device in another room or a closed bag.
- Set a 5–10 minute morning timer. Sit quietly and briefly reflect on mortality—acknowledge life’s finiteness, imagine today as precious—and identify on...

## Conclusion

Improving presence is a journey, not a destination. The strategies we've explored in this guide—backed by research from leading scientists in positive psychology—offer a roadmap for meaningful progress.

Remember that small, consistent actions often outperform ambitious but unsustainable efforts. Start with one technique that resonates with you, practice it until it feels natural, then gradually expand your repertoire.

The science is clear: we have more control over our well-being than we often realize. By applying evidence-based strategies, you can make real progress toward a happier, more fulfilling life.
