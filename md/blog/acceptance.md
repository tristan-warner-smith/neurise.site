# Letting Go: How Acceptance Leads to Inner Peace


Acceptance is something many of us struggle with, yet the science of happiness and well-being has revealed powerful strategies that can make a real difference.

Brief daily reflection on mortality can increase presence and appreciation.

In this guide, we'll explore evidence-based approaches to acceptance, drawing on the latest research in positive psychology and behavioral science. You'll learn practical strategies you can implement today, backed by studies from leading researchers in the field.

Whether you're just starting your wellness journey or looking to deepen your practice, these insights will help you make meaningful progress.

## Understanding Acceptance

Before diving into strategies, it's important to understand why acceptance matters for our overall well-being.

Remembering life’s finiteness often boosts gratitude and purpose, two reliable levers for well-being. A quick daily practice strengthens intention (autonomy) and helps you savor meaningful moments (positive emotions) and people (connection).

The connection between acceptance and happiness is well-documented in research. When we actively work on this area of our lives, we often see ripple effects in other domains—from our relationships to our work performance.


Research insight: Brief daily reflection on mortality can increase presence and appreciation. (Brem et al., 2016; Irvine, 2017)

## Strategy 1: Memento Mori

Remembering life’s finiteness often boosts gratitude and purpose, two reliable levers for well-being. A quick daily practice strengthens intention (autonomy) and helps you savor meaningful moments (positive emotions) and people (connection).

**How to apply this:**

Set a 5–10 minute morning timer. Sit quietly and briefly reflect on mortality—acknowledge life’s finiteness, imagine today as precious—and identify one meaningful action you will prioritize before noon.

Research note: "Brief, structured memento mori exercises are intended to cultivate gratitude and reduce reactivity, not induce rumination." — Irvine, 2017

## Strategy 2: Anxiety Management

Deferring worry interrupts spirals and restores focus, supporting well-being and more intentional action. Accepting limits of control reduces perfectionist pressure to pre-solve every possible problem.

**How to apply this:**

Take 5 minutes to put a 20-minute “Worry Window” in your calendar within 48 hours; until then, tell yourself, “I’ll cross that bridge when I come to it.”

## Strategy 3: Acceptance

Acceptance and self-compassion help regulate emotions and reduce reactivity, strengthening mental well-being and relationships. You build mastery by practicing on small waves of feeling.

**How to apply this:**

When a tough feeling appears today, pause for 5 minutes: say “It’s okay to feel this,” track its sensations in your body, breathe slowly, and let it pass before choosing your next step.

Research note: "Reality unfolds without our micromanagement, inviting acceptance of what is rather than futile control." — Singer et al., 2015

## What the Research Shows

The strategies we've discussed aren't just anecdotal—they're backed by rigorous scientific research. Here's what the evidence tells us:

**Key findings:**

- **More than four million students have taken Dr. Laurie Santos' online course The Science of Well-Being**: Indicates the popularity and reach of her work on happiness (Dr. Laurie Santos' course on Coursera)
- **Most psychological interventions increase happiness by about 10%**: Reflects the realistic magnitude of happiness improvements achievable (General happiness science research cited by Dr. Laurie Santos)
- **Average flight delays out of O'Hare airport are 32 minutes**: Used to illustrate managing expectations and acceptance of unavoidable annoyances (Ryan Holiday's personal observation)
- **People on death row show a two-to-one ratio of strongly positive and other-oriented words as they near death**: Evidence that positivity increases near death despite circumstances (Unspecified psychological study referenced by Dr. Laurie Santos)
- **Over 300 million people saw Elmo's social media check-in; millions responded**: Demonstrates widespread engagement and need for mental health check-ins (Sesame Workshop social media campaign)

## Putting It Into Practice

Knowing the science is one thing—putting it into practice is another. Here's how to start:

**Start small**: Pick just one strategy from this guide and commit to trying it for a week. Small, consistent actions compound over time.

**Track your progress**: Notice how you feel before and after implementing these practices. Awareness helps reinforce positive habits.

**Be patient**: Meaningful change takes time. Research shows it can take anywhere from 18 to 254 days to form a new habit, with an average of 66 days.

**Get support**: Consider using tools designed to help you build these habits. Apps like Neurise provide personalized, science-backed recommendations tailored to your specific needs and goals.

## Conclusion

Improving acceptance is a journey, not a destination. The strategies we've explored in this guide—backed by research from leading scientists in positive psychology—offer a roadmap for meaningful progress.

Remember that small, consistent actions often outperform ambitious but unsustainable efforts. Start with one technique that resonates with you, practice it until it feels natural, then gradually expand your repertoire.

The science is clear: we have more control over our well-being than we often realize. By applying evidence-based strategies, you can make real progress toward a happier, more fulfilling life.
