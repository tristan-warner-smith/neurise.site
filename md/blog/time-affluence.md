# The Gift of Time: Creating Space for What Matters


Time Affluence is something many of us struggle with, yet the science of happiness and well-being has revealed powerful strategies that can make a real difference.

Setting boundaries to create time affluence is crucial for mental health and happiness.

In this guide, we'll explore evidence-based approaches to time affluence, drawing on the latest research in positive psychology and behavioral science. You'll learn practical strategies you can implement today, backed by studies from leading researchers in the field.

Whether you're just starting your wellness journey or looking to deepen your practice, these insights will help you make meaningful progress.

## Understanding Time Affluence

Before diving into strategies, it's important to understand why time affluence matters for our overall well-being.

Time affluence supports mental health and happiness by reducing stress and enabling meaningful activities. Guarding even a small block of discretionary time can shift your day’s tone.

The connection between time affluence and happiness is well-documented in research. When we actively work on this area of our lives, we often see ripple effects in other domains—from our relationships to our work performance.


Research insight: Setting boundaries to create time affluence is crucial for mental health and happiness. (Whillans et al., 2021)

## Strategy 1: Time Affluence

Time affluence supports mental health and happiness by reducing stress and enabling meaningful activities. Guarding even a small block of discretionary time can shift your day’s tone.

**How to apply this:**

Block 30 minutes on your calendar today for a meaningful, discretionary activity and explicitly decline or delegate one non‑essential task to protect it.

Research note: "Setting boundaries to create time affluence is crucial for mental health and happiness." — Whillans et al., 2021

## Strategy 2: Digital Wellbeing

Mindful tech use lowers distraction and protects time for relationships and rest. Reclaiming attention improves mood and makes room for activities that genuinely matter to you.

**How to apply this:**

Before unlocking your phone today, pause for 10–20 seconds and ask: What for? Why now? What else could I do instead? If there’s no clear purpose, do the “what else.”

Research note: "Mindful use of technology by questioning purpose and timing of phone use (WWW: What for? Why now? What else?) increases digital well-being." — Price, 2021

## Strategy 3: Waiting In Lines

Connection and positive emotions are reliable well-being levers. Reclaiming micro-moments in lines counteracts time famine and builds social confidence.

**How to apply this:**

Next time you are standing in line, initiate a brief conversation with the person next to you.

Research note: "People spend approximately 7,000 hours waiting in lines over their lifetime—an opportunity to connect instead of disengage." — Santos, 2019

## What the Research Shows

The strategies we've discussed aren't just anecdotal—they're backed by rigorous scientific research. Here's what the evidence tells us:

**Key findings:**

- **Self-reported time scarcity has similar negative well-being effects as unemployment.**: Time affluence research (Ashley Whillans, Harvard Business School)
- **7,000 hours**: Estimated lifetime time spent waiting in lines (Aaron Santos' calculations)
- **1.3 million**: Estimated number of ATMs installed worldwide (Industry reports)
- **16-minute 5k time**: Georgia's time at a local UK park run after her comeback (Georgia Bell's personal performance)
- **30 miles per week running**: Current training volume compared to previous 55-60 miles per week in US collegiate system (Georgia Bell's training regimen)

## Putting It Into Practice

Knowing the science is one thing—putting it into practice is another. Here's how to start:

**Start small**: Pick just one strategy from this guide and commit to trying it for a week. Small, consistent actions compound over time.

**Track your progress**: Notice how you feel before and after implementing these practices. Awareness helps reinforce positive habits.

**Be patient**: Meaningful change takes time. Research shows it can take anywhere from 18 to 254 days to form a new habit, with an average of 66 days.

**Get support**: Consider using tools designed to help you build these habits. Apps like Neurise provide personalized, science-backed recommendations tailored to your specific needs and goals.

**Quick-start actions:**

- Block 30 minutes on your calendar today for a meaningful, discretionary activity and explicitly decline or delegate one non‑essential task to protect ...

- Next time you are standing in line, initiate a brief conversation with the person next to you.

## Conclusion

Improving time affluence is a journey, not a destination. The strategies we've explored in this guide—backed by research from leading scientists in positive psychology—offer a roadmap for meaningful progress.

Remember that small, consistent actions often outperform ambitious but unsustainable efforts. Start with one technique that resonates with you, practice it until it feels natural, then gradually expand your repertoire.

The science is clear: we have more control over our well-being than we often realize. By applying evidence-based strategies, you can make real progress toward a happier, more fulfilling life.
