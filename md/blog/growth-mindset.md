# Fixed vs. Growth: The Mindset That Changes Everything


Growth Mindset is something many of us struggle with, yet the science of happiness and well-being has revealed powerful strategies that can make a real difference.

Practicing non-judgmental awareness and reducing cognitive distortions during play improves performance and self-compassion.

In this guide, we'll explore evidence-based approaches to growth mindset, drawing on the latest research in positive psychology and behavioral science. You'll learn practical strategies you can implement today, backed by studies from leading researchers in the field.

Whether you're just starting your wellness journey or looking to deepen your practice, these insights will help you make meaningful progress.

## Understanding Growth Mindset

Before diving into strategies, it's important to understand why growth mindset matters for our overall well-being.

Non‑judgmental awareness reduces rumination and keeps you in the present, which helps both performance and well-being. Practicing this in play makes it easier to apply in everyday stressors too.

The connection between growth mindset and happiness is well-documented in research. When we actively work on this area of our lives, we often see ripple effects in other domains—from our relationships to our work performance.


Research insight: Practicing non-judgmental awareness and reducing cognitive distortions during play improves performance and self-compassion. (Kern et al., 2019)

## Strategy 1: Mindfulness

Non‑judgmental awareness reduces rumination and keeps you in the present, which helps both performance and well-being. Practicing this in play makes it easier to apply in everyday stressors too.

**How to apply this:**

Set a 10‑minute timer. Before each throw: take 3 slow breaths, feel your feet and shoulders, silently label any distorted thought (e.g., “catastrophizing”), then refocus on the next throw.

Research note: "Practicing self-compassion, including mindfulness of suffering, recognizing common humanity, and self-kindness, enhances motivation and reduces procrastination." — Neff, 2011

## Strategy 2: Self-Compassion

Self-compassion fuels resilience and healthy motivation. Modeling it gives children the script they’ll use for life—especially when things go wrong.

**How to apply this:**

Take 5–10 minutes to pick a recent minor mistake and say aloud, “I messed up, and that’s okay—I can learn and try again,” either in front of your child or by rehearsing the exact words you’ll use next time.

Research note: "Practicing non-judgmental awareness and reducing cognitive distortions during play improves performance and self-compassion." — Kern et al., 2019

## Strategy 3: Intrinsic Motivation

Kids thrive when they feel autonomy, mastery, and genuine interest rather than pressure to impress. Reframing how you praise boosts internal drive and resilience, making setbacks feel like part of growth instead of threats to worth.

**How to apply this:**

Set a 10-minute timer to rewrite five common praise phrases into effort/curiosity versions and post the list where you’ll see it before your next parent–child interaction.

Research note: "Parents should focus on fostering intrinsic motivation in children rather than relying on extrinsic rewards." — Deci et al., 1999

## What the Research Shows

The strategies we've discussed aren't just anecdotal—they're backed by rigorous scientific research. Here's what the evidence tells us:

**Key findings:**

- **76%**: Percentage of US adults reporting stress affecting their health (American Psychological Association poll)
- **70-80% of people experience a life-threatening event; only 8-10% develop PTSD**: Prevalence of trauma and PTSD in the general population (Epidemiological data referenced by Dr. Sue Varma)
- **Optimists live 10-15% longer and have 30% less likelihood of anxiety and depression**: Health and longevity benefits of optimism (Meta-analysis of over 200,000 people cited by Dr. Sue Varma)
- **Optimists are 40% more likely to get a raise in the next year**: Social and occupational benefits of optimism (Research cited by Dr. Sue Varma)
- **85% of worries never actually happen**: Cognitive reframing and worry management (Common psychological statistic referenced by Dr. Sue Varma)

## Putting It Into Practice

Knowing the science is one thing—putting it into practice is another. Here's how to start:

**Start small**: Pick just one strategy from this guide and commit to trying it for a week. Small, consistent actions compound over time.

**Track your progress**: Notice how you feel before and after implementing these practices. Awareness helps reinforce positive habits.

**Be patient**: Meaningful change takes time. Research shows it can take anywhere from 18 to 254 days to form a new habit, with an average of 66 days.

**Get support**: Consider using tools designed to help you build these habits. Apps like Neurise provide personalized, science-backed recommendations tailored to your specific needs and goals.

**Quick-start actions:**

## Conclusion

Improving growth mindset is a journey, not a destination. The strategies we've explored in this guide—backed by research from leading scientists in positive psychology—offer a roadmap for meaningful progress.

Remember that small, consistent actions often outperform ambitious but unsustainable efforts. Start with one technique that resonates with you, practice it until it feels natural, then gradually expand your repertoire.

The science is clear: we have more control over our well-being than we often realize. By applying evidence-based strategies, you can make real progress toward a happier, more fulfilling life.
